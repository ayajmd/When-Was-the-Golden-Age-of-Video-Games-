# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games-
Introduction

The video game industry has experienced remarkable growth, evolving into a multi-billion-dollar market. This project delves into the dynamic world of video games, seeking to assess whether games have shown improvement over time and to pinpoint potential golden eras. Through an examination of game sales data, critic reviews, and user feedback, our aim is to illuminate the trajectory of video game quality.

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of two primary tables: game_sales and reviews, containing comprehensive information on game sales, critical reviews, and user ratings. These tables enable us to explore the relationship between game sales, critical reception, and release years.

Key Steps

1. Top Selling Video Games: Our initial exploration focuses on the top ten best-selling video games, investigating their respective platforms, publishers, developers, sales figures, and release years.

2. Missing Review Scores: We identify games lacking review scores and acknowledge the limitation of our analysis due to this missing data.

3. Years Praised by Critics: Analyzing the average critic scores for games released across different years, we aim to uncover potential golden years according to critics' assessments.

4. Decline in Critical Acclaim: We scrutinize years that have fallen off the radar of critics' favorites due to a scarcity of reviewed games.

5. Years Beloved by Players: Our attention shifts to average user scores, allowing us to pinpoint the years most adored by players.

6. Convergence of Critical and Player Praise: By comparing the years esteemed by both critics and players, we identify periods that receive accolades from both demographics.

7. Sales Performance in Peak Years: We ascertain the sales figures for the years endorsed by both critics and players, providing insights into the commercial success of these periods.

Conclusion

Through meticulous analysis of game sales, critic reviews, and user feedback, this project provides valuable insights into potential golden eras within the video game industry. By juxtaposing the perspectives of both critics and players, we attain a comprehensive understanding of the quality and popularity of video games. These findings contribute significantly to ongoing discussions surrounding the evolution and impact of video games on the gaming market.
